# Theatre of Blood Plugins

_Note: This list of plugins is incomplete and will be updated over time._

## General

### Party / Hub Party Panel

While not ToB-specific, the Party plugin is perhaps the most essential
plugin to have when doing any group PvM. At its core, it shares basic
information about your character with your teammates, such as your
current hitpoints, prayer points, and special attack energy. More
importantly, it provides a mechanism for other plugins to share
information, enabling many features which greatly improve your raid
experience.

One such plugin that builds on Party is the
[Hub Party Panel](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/party-panel).
This extends the shared party data to include your stats, gear,
inventory, and prayers.

### Special Attack Counter

Special Attack Counter is a builtin Runelite plugin which tracks how
many defence-reducing special attacks you've landed on a boss. It
integrates with the Party plugin to share this information with your
teammates.

### Party Defence Tracker

[Party Defence Tracker](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/party-defence-tracker)
builds on top of the Special Attack Counter plugin to automatically
calculate the Defence level of a boss as your team hits special attacks
and display it in an infobox, removing the need for you to remember
special attack counts.

### ToB QoL

[ToB QoL](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/tobqol) offers a variety
of quality of life features throughout every room of the Theatre of Blood.
There are too many to list here; we encourage you to try them out to see
which you find useful. A selection of the most notable features include:

- **Instance Timers**. This is an essential toggle for both the Nylocas
  and Xarpus. It displays the game's internal instance timer on which
  these rooms operate, allowing you to time your entry to start the room
  as quickly as possible.

  When you enter the Nylocas or Xarpus instance, a tick counter from 0-3
  will appear over your head. If you are the player starting the room,
  click the barrier to bring up the start menu, then click to enter when
  the displayed tick is 0.

- **Maiden & Verzik crab health**. These options display the hitpoints of
  red crabs at Maiden and Verzik as a number, allowing you to know when
  to stop attacking them.

- **Object hiders**. You can hide the ceiling chains at Bloat, along with
  various objects in the Nylocas room, reducing visual clutter.

- **Room timers**. Displays live timers in each room, showing important
  splits.

## The Pestilent Bloat

### Ground Object Hider

It can be difficult to see shadows on Bloat's floor through its default
texture, leading to embarrassing deaths. The
[Ground Object Hider](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/object-hider)
plugin allows you to remove this floor texture. To achieve this, list
the following object IDs in the plugin's settings:

```plaintext
32941, 32942, 32943, 32944, 32945, 32946, 32947, 32948
```

However, this alone isn't enough, since the floor otherwise appears as a
black void. To change this, use the builtin Skybox plugin to set both
the Overworld and Cave skyboxes to a color of your choice.

<Notice type="warning">

You must set _both_ the Overworld and Cave skyboxes, or the floor will
still occasionally appear black.

## The Nylocas

### Nyloer

[Nyloer](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/nyloer) offers several
helpful tools for the Nylocas room.

#### Wave numbers [#nyloer-wave-numbers]

Nyloer's most useful feature is its wave indicators, which display the
wave number over every Nylo that spawns, as well as whether the Nylo is
a split. This makes it easy to prioritize Nylos which are newer,
avoiding killing those which will expire soon.

To enable wave numbers, tick the _Show Nylocas Wave_ option in the
plugin's _General Settings_:

/>

#### Dimming [#nyloer-dimming]

A related feature is the ability to visually darken the wave numbers of
any Nylos currently in the room ("dimming"). Doing so provides a visual
indicator of which Nylos to avoid targeting, as they will expire
naturally before a key threshold.

Most commonly, players will set a _Darker Wave_ (and sometimes _Darker
Wave Offset_) under Nyloer's _Font Settings_ before starting the room.
Nyloer will then automatically dim Nylos as soon as the specified wave
and tick offsets are reached. The specific wave and tick offsets are
determined based on the boss spawn time a team is targeting. The most
common configurations are listed below.

| Boss spawn time | Darker wave | Tick offset |
| :-------------: | :---------: | :---------: |
|     2:48.0      |     26      |      0      |
|     2:50.4      |     27      |      0      |
|     2:52.8      |     27      |      4      |
|     2:55.2      |     28      |      0      |

Nyloer also allows setting a _Make Darker Hotkey_ to manually dim Nylos
on demand. This is more advanced, requiring an understanding of the
Nylocas room cycle, but can be invaluable to experienced players.

#### Role menu swaps [#nyloer-role-menu-swaps]

Nyloer also allows you to configure menu priorities for your role,
prioritizing its relevant Nylo style(s), allowing you to simply left
click on a stack of Nylos to attack the one you want. This replaces the
need for the Custom Menu Swaps plugin which players previously used for
this purpose.

Nyloer comes with default menu swaps for the Mage, Ranger, and Melee
roles, which you can quickly switch between by clicking a button in the
plugin's sidebar panel. You can also customize these menu swaps to your
preference in the plugin's settings.

### Nylo Death Indicators

[Nylo Death Indicators](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/nylo-death-indicators)
tracks your experience drops as you attack Nylos and immediately hides
Nylos that will die to your attacks, before the client visually
registers their death. Better yet, it integrates with the Party plugin,
also removing the dead Nylo from your teammates' screens. This is
incredibly useful to avoid doubling up on Nylos that your teammates have
already killed.
