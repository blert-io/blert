      <p>
        This guide is targeted at players learning max-eff trio moneys or
        speedruns. It assumes a base understanding of the room&apos;s mechanics,
        which you can learn in the{' '}

      <p>
        In trio waves, you are aiming for 2:55.2 or 2:57.6 boss spawn. Your goal
        is to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Avoid stalling at all until at least wave 28.</li>
        <li>
          Allow all the existing Nylos in the room to auto-pop once wave 28/29
          spawns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kill all new Nylos after the wave 28 spawn (not including wave 28, but
          the Nylos that spawn afterwards&mdash;both splits and waves 29/30/31).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With no mistakes, you should be able to avoid stalling until at least
        wave 28 almost 100% of the time.

        Refer to the <Link href="/guides/tob/plugins">Plugins guide</Link> for
        information about setting up useful ToB plugins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nyloer plugin allows you to automatically dim every Nylo currently
        in the room at a specific wave by setting the{' '}
        <Link href="/guides/tob/plugins#nyloer-dimming">Darker Wave</Link>{' '}
        option within its <em>Font Settings</em> tab. This visually
        distinguishes relevant smalls from those which will automatically expire
        by certain time thresholds.
      </p>
      <Article.Notice type="info">
        <p>
          When playing for a 2:55.2 boss spawn, set your <em>Darker Wave</em> to{' '}
          <strong>28</strong>.
        </p>
      </Article.Notice>
      <p>
        Additionally, you can set a <em>Make Darker Hotkey</em> to manually dim
        existing Nylos. Dimming on the wave 22 spawn (1:45.6 room time) is
        recommended, as wave 22 and older Nylos will explode naturally before
        the stall check on 28, whereas killing Nylos spawning after 22 will help
        reduce stalls on the last few waves.

        kill splits in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        When wave 19 spawns, Sang the <Mage>19 east mage big</Mage> on the
        second tick standing one tile away from the east barrier to increase the
        projectile&apos;s travel time, causing its splits to spawn after the
        wave 20 check. Follow up by Ayaking the <Mage>19 west big</Mage>, then
        the <Mage>19 south big</Mage> in lane.
      </p>
      <Article.Notice>
        In a proficient team, if the 12 big was popped and the room state is
        clean, you can Ayak the 17 south big before cleaning up splits. Be ready
        to Ayak the 19 big two ticks after it spawns.

      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="mage" text="Wave 20" />
      <p>
        Ayak the <Mage>20 south mage big</Mage>, ideally on the first tick. If
        you attack on the first tick and it doesn&apos;t die, you can hit a
        second Ayak before it flickers. Otherwise, Blowpipe it when it flickers,
        then Scythe to finish it off.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the big dies in one Ayak, you can do 4 more Ayaks before wave 21,
        prioritizing any remaining bigs.

      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="mage" text="Waves 21-23" />
      <p>
        Barrage the <Mage>21 west doubles</Mage>. Then, either Ayak a small in
        the room or Barrage once if you see a value clump. Barrage value here is
        good if the room appears full.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ayak the <Mage>22 east big</Mage>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If it dies in one Ayak, Ayak 2 smalls in the room. You can look for
          another value Barrage to push waves if the room is full.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it does not die, Scythe it on the first tick it enters the room, or
          Claw scratch if it is low HP.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ayak the <Mage>23 east big</Mage>. If your ranger didn&apos;t kill the{' '}

      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="mage" text="Waves 24-27" />
      <p>
        During these waves, your job is to quickly kill all of the mage bigs
        which spawn to get their splits out early.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ayak the <Mage>24 south big</Mage> until it dies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ayak the <Mage>25 east big</Mage>. If you attack on the first tick it
          spawns, you can get a second Ayak before it flickers. If you one-shot
          it, Ayak a small in the room while moving west.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ayak the <Mage>26 west big</Mage> once. If it dies in one Ayak, hit a
          small before hitting 27.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ayak the <Mage>27 west big</Mage> until it dies. Return to the{' '}
          <Mage>26 west big</Mage> if your previous Ayak didn&apos;t kill it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ayak the <Mage>27 east big</Mage> until it dies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kill the <Mage>26 east big</Mage> on the northeast pillar. There are
          often mage splits around it allowing you to Barrage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="mage" text="Waves 28-29" />
      <p>
        Finish off any remaining mage bigs, while looking out for high value
        Barrages. Continue Ayaking smalls with the highest wave number.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="mage" text="Waves 30-31" />
      <p>
        Kill the <Mage>30 east big</Mage> as quickly as possible, followed by
        the <Mage>31 east small</Mage>. If the 30 dies in one hit, you can
        Blowpipe both the 31 east smalls (the mage flickers ranged) to help your
        ranger.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={3} idPrefix="mage" text="Cleanup" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prioritize cleaning up the north side of the room after the 31s are
          dead. Look for high value Barrages, but avoid clumps with dimmed
          Nylos.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a dimmed and undimmed Nylo are stacked, right click and target the
          bottom one in the menu, as it is the newest.
        </li>
        <li>
          When Ayaking or Barraging, move as close as possible to your targets
          to minimize projectile travel time.

        Stand one tile back from the barrier after Scything the doubles. If you

        Pay attention to how far ahead your mage is. If they are behind, Ayak

        <p>
          Proficient teams can opt to play waves 17&ndash;20 more aggressively

        <ul>
          <li>
            If the 12 melee big is killed, you can commit to killing the 17 west
            mage big.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the 17 east and west mage bigs are killed, you should clean up
            splits before bowing the 18 west ranged big when it spawns. Continue
            kiling splits until the 19 mage bigs are about to flash melee, then
            kill the rest of the 18 ranged bigs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the room is not clean enough to bow the 18 west ranged big, clean
            splits until wave 19 spawns. Wait 2 ticks then Ayak the 19 south
            mage big and start killing all the 18 ranged bigs. (Tip: Blowpipe a
            non-aggro 18 big before Blowpiping the west aggro big to prevent
            overkill from Veng/thralls.)

      <p>
        After you bow the 20 west big, you can do 6-8 ticks worth of attacks and
        then chin the <Range>east wave 21 ranged doubles</Range>. 6 ticks of
        attacks will let you chin them tick perfect; you don&apos;t want to do
        more than 8 or you will chin after the wave 22 check. After you chin,
        kill splits in the room until the <Melee>wave 22 west big</Melee>{' '}
        flashes green and bow it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more advanced method is to Claw spec the <Melee>20 west big</Melee>,
        then fill 5 ticks worth of attacks before first tick chinning the{' '}
        <Range>east wave 21 ranged doubles</Range>. Cast Death Charge any time
        after the Claw spec to regen 100 spec for the boss.

      <p>
        After bowing the 22 west big, make your way to the south lane. You can
        do 1 Blowpipe then bow the <Range>south wave 23 ranged big</Range> tick
        perfect. After you bow it, run west and kill the right (N) then left (S)
        smalls as they flash ranged. Bow the <Range>24 west big</Range> after
        the second Blowpipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Head south. You can do 1 Blowpipe before bowing the{' '}
        <Range>wave 25 south ranged big</Range> if the room is clean. If you
        one-shot the wave 23 south range big earlier, its splits will spawn in
        the lane and you should Blowpipe one of these if either are range. If
        the room is not clean, clean up some smalls before Blowpiping the 25
        south ranged big.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="ranger" text="Waves 26-27" />
      <p>
        After you bow the wave 25 south big, start cleaning up any range splits
        you see. Don&apos;t get baited into killing splits that will soon expire
        (any splits from wave 20 or 21 will expire before 28 check), and try to
        stay on tick with the room (Blowpipe will keep you on tick with the room
        assuming you don&apos;t lose any ticks; if you chin or Ayak, you will
        have to either do a second chin/Ayak or lose a tick). Kill the{' '}
        <Range>wave 27 south big</Range> once it turns green.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more advanced method you can use if the room is clean after killing
        the 25 south ranged big is to help Ayak the 26 or 27 east mage bigs
        before Blowpiping the 27 south ranged big once it turns green.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="ranger" text="Waves 28-29" />
      <p>
        Start looking for ranged/mage splits that spawned after wave 28 while
        making your way west, and prioritize Blowpiping or Ayaking these instead
        of the wave 28 south flashers (which will expire in cleanup). Kill
        splits on the east side of the room first as you move west.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blowpipe the wave 29 west flashers. Your team will likely stall after
        this. Stay on the west side of the room and hit splits/smalls that
        spawned after wave 28 while staying on tick (you are on tick with the
        room after Blowpiping the 29 flashers).
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="ranger" text="Waves 30-31" />
      <p>
        When wave 30 spawns, Blowpipe the <Range>west ranged big</Range> from 2
        tiles off the lane, then run 2 tiles back and chin the wave 30 south
        doubles when they flash green (you must be on tick with the room for
        this; make sure you target the eastern Nylo of the doubles). Blowpipe
        the wave 31 west flashers, then chin the <Range>31 south doubles</Range>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, if wave 29 stalled and you are waiting for wave 30 after
        running out of new splits to kill, you can first tick Blowpipe the wave
        30 west ranged big from the barrier, then run 4 tiles back to chin the
        wave 30 south doubles.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={3} idPrefix="ranger" text="Cleanup" />
      <p>
        Kill any wave 29/31 smalls first as these will change color if you
        don&apos;t kill them quickly enough. Don&apos;t get baited into chinning
        a clump with 28s in it as 28s will expire. After killing any 29+
        rangers, look to kill other colors (mage &gt; melee), working from the
        south to the north side.

        Kill splits from any popped w17 bigs while waiting for wave 19 to spawn,

      <p>
        For the wave 20 check, 1 w15, 3 w18s and 3 w19s will always be alive
        (7/12). This means that the number of smalls you can have in the room
        depends on how many of the wave 17 bigs were killed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All 3 w17s died: up to 4 smalls</li>
        <li>2 w17s died: up to 3 smalls</li>
        <li>1 w17 died: up to 2 smalls</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Prioritize killing smalls until you get below this threshold. If you
        recognize that you are not going to stall, sang the <Mage>west 19</Mage>{' '}
        in the lane and start helping with other 18s/19s.

        Kill the <Melee>east big</Melee> (Scythe or Blowpipe{' '}
        <i className="fas fa-arrow-right" /> Swift). If the mage and ranger have
        not managed to kill the south and west bigs, finish them off. Splits
        need to spawn by 1:45.6 to expire before the stall check on wave 28.

      <p>
        By the time you kill the 26 big, 28 should have spawned. A lot of bigs
        will just have died and be spawning splits. Kill as many of the splits
        that spawned after wave 28 as you can until it&apos;s time to hit wave
        29.
      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="melee" text="Wave 29" />
      <p>
        Kill the <Melee>south big melee</Melee> on the first tick possible, then

      </p>
      <Article.Heading level={4} idPrefix="melee" text="Wave 30" />

      <p>
        At this point, kill all relevant melees starting from the south. Fill
        ticks on rangers or mages at your discretion if you need to. Ranger and
        or mage should help with north melees if they finish before you; if you
        finish the melees first, help them as needed.
