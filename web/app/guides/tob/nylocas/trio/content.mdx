## Overview

This guide is targeted at players learning max-eff trio moneys or speedruns. It
assumes a base understanding of the room's mechanics, which you can learn in the
[Nylocas mechanics guide](/guides/tob/nylocas/mechanics).

### Team goals

In trio waves, you are aiming for 2:55.2 or 2:57.6 boss spawn. Your goal is to:

1. Avoid stalling at all until at least wave 28.
2. Allow all the existing Nylos in the room to auto-pop once wave 28/29 spawns.
3. Kill all new Nylos after the wave 28 spawn (not including wave 28, but the
   Nylos that spawn afterwards&mdash;both splits and waves 29/30/31).

With no mistakes, you should be able to avoid stalling until at least wave 28
almost 100% of the time.

### Plugins

Refer to the [Plugins guide](/guides/tob/plugins) for information about setting
up useful ToB plugins.

The Nyloer plugin allows you to automatically dim every Nylo currently in the
room at a specific wave by setting the
[Darker Wave](/guides/tob/plugins#nyloer-dimming) option within its
_Font Settings_ tab. This visually distinguishes relevant smalls from those
which will automatically expire by certain time thresholds.

<Notice type="info">

When playing for a 2:55.2 boss spawn, set your _Darker Wave_ to **28**.

</Notice>

Additionally, you can set a _Make Darker Hotkey_ to manually dim existing Nylos.
Dimming on the wave 22 spawn (1:45.6 room time) is recommended, as wave 22 and
older Nylos will explode naturally before the stall check on 28, whereas killing
Nylos spawning after 22 will help reduce stalls on the last few waves.

## Mage Waves

### Pre-cap [#mage-pre-cap]

#### Waves 1-3 [#mage-waves-1-3]

Ayak the <Mage>w1 south small</Mage>, **ignore** the w2 west small, and Ayak
the <Mage>w3 east small</Mage>.

#### Wave 4 [#mage-wave-4]

Ayak the <Mage>south big</Mage> first tick until it is dead, hugging the south
barrier.

#### Wave 5 [#mage-wave-5]

Ayak the <Mage>east small</Mage> until it is dead, then clean up any mages in
the room. If the w5 west big split into two mages, prioritize the northern one.

#### Waves 6-7 [#mage-waves-6-7]

Ayak the <Mage>w6 west small</Mage>, then the <Mage>w7 south small</Mage>.
Blowpipe the south rangers if they are still alive, prioritizing the big.

#### Waves 8-9 [#mage-waves-8-9]

Ayak the <Mage>wave 8 west big</Mage> until it is dead.

- If it takes 1 Ayak, switch to ranged gear and bow the <Range>9 west big</Range>.
- If it takes 2 Ayaks, bow the <Range>9 west big</Range> once.
- If it takes 3 or more Ayaks, Blowpipe the ranged big once.

Ayak the <Mage>9 east small</Mage>. If you managed to one-shot the 8 big, Ayak
another small in the room.

#### Waves 10-12 [#mage-waves-10-12]

Bow the <Range>10 east big</Range> once, then Blowpipe
the <Range>10 east small</Range> once.

Barrage the <Mage>11 east doubles</Mage>, then the <Mage>11 south doubles</Mage>.
If you one-hit both sets of doubles, Ayak a small mage from the 10 east big or
11 west big.

If there are only 2 smalls in the room, Scythe the <Melee>12 south melee big</Melee>.
Hit remaining smalls.

#### Waves 13-15 [#mage-waves-13-15]

Ayak the <Mage>13 west small</Mage>, the <Mage>14 west small</Mage>, and
the <Mage>14 south small</Mage>. Ayak the <Mage>15 east mage small</Mage> and
Blowpipe the <Range>15 west ranged small</Range> if your ranger hasn't killed
it.

#### Waves 16-19 [#mage-waves-16-19]

Ayak the <Mage>16 east small</Mage>, the <Mage>17 east big</Mage>, then kill
splits in the room.

When wave 19 spawns, Ayak the <Mage>19 east mage big</Mage> on the second tick
standing one tile away from the east barrier to increase the projectile's travel
time, causing its splits to spawn after the wave 20 check. Follow up by Ayaking
the <Mage>19 west big</Mage>, then the <Mage>19 south big</Mage> in lane.

<Notice>

In a proficient team, if the 12 big was popped and the room state is clean, you
can Ayak the 17 south big before cleaning up splits. Be ready to Ayak the 19 big
two ticks after it spawns.

</Notice>

### Post-cap [#mage-post-cap]

#### Wave 20 [#mage-wave-20]

Ayak the <Mage>20 south mage big</Mage>, ideally on the first tick. If you
attack on the first tick and it doesn't die, you can hit a second Ayak before it
flickers. Otherwise, Blowpipe it when it flickers, then Scythe to finish it off.

If the big dies in one Ayak, you can do 4 more Ayaks before wave 21,
prioritizing any remaining bigs.

#### Waves 21-23 [#mage-waves-21-23]

Barrage the <Mage>21 west doubles</Mage>. Then, either Ayak a small in the room
or Barrage once if you see a value clump. Barrage value here is good if the room
appears full.

Ayak the <Mage>22 east big</Mage>.

- If it dies in one Ayak, Ayak 2 smalls in the room. You can look for another
  value Barrage to push waves if the room is full.
- If it does not die, Scythe it on the first tick it enters the room, or Claw
  scratch if it is low HP.

Ayak the <Mage>23 east big</Mage>. If your ranger didn't kill
the <Range>23 south big</Range>, Ayak it when it flickers. Otherwise, hit a small.

#### Waves 24-27 [#mage-waves-24-27]

During these waves, your job is to quickly kill all of the mage bigs which spawn
to get their splits out early.

- Ayak the <Mage>24 south big</Mage> until it dies.
- Ayak the <Mage>25 east big</Mage>. If you attack on the first tick it spawns,
  you can get a second Ayak before it flickers. If you one-shot it, Ayak a small
  in the room while moving west.
- Ayak the <Mage>26 west big</Mage> once. If it dies in one Ayak, hit a small
  before hitting 27.
- Ayak the <Mage>27 west big</Mage> until it dies. Return to the
  <Mage>26 west big</Mage> if your previous Ayak didn't kill it.
- Ayak the <Mage>27 east big</Mage> until it dies.
- Kill the <Mage>26 east big</Mage> on the northeast pillar. There are often
  mage splits around it allowing you to Barrage.

#### Waves 28-29 [#mage-waves-28-29]

Finish off any remaining mage bigs, while looking out for high value Barrages.
Continue Ayaking smalls with the highest wave number.

#### Waves 30-31 [#mage-waves-30-31]

Kill the <Mage>30 east big</Mage> as quickly as possible, followed by
the <Mage>31 east small</Mage>. If the 30 dies in one hit, you can Blowpipe both
the 31 east smalls (the mage flickers ranged) to help your ranger.

### Cleanup [#mage-cleanup]

- Prioritize cleaning up the north side of the room after the 31s are dead. Look
  for high value Barrages, but avoid clumps with dimmed Nylos.
- If a dimmed and undimmed Nylo are stacked, right click and target the bottom
  one in the menu, as it is the newest.
- When Ayaking or Barraging, move as close as possible to your targets to
  minimize projectile travel time.

## Ranger Waves

### Pre-cap [#ranger-pre-cap]

#### Waves 1-3 [#ranger-waves-1-3]

Bow the <Range>w1 west small</Range>, the <Range>w2 east small</Range>,
and the <Range>w3 south small</Range>.

#### Waves 4-7 [#ranger-waves-4-7]

Blowpipe the <Range>wave 4 west small</Range> and bow
the <Range>wave 5 big</Range> behind it (which your melee will double up on).
Hover the splits that will spawn from the wave 4 mage big and the wave 5 ranged
big, prioritizing the ranged and mage splits. You can Blowpipe 2 splits and
tick-perfectly chin into bow the <Range>wave 6 ranged small</Range>
and <Range>wave 7 big</Range>.

#### Waves 8-10 [#ranger-waves-8-10]

Path west and stand 1 tile away from the west barrier. Ayak the

<Mage>8 mage big</Mage> then chin the <Range>9 ranged big</Range>. If the mage
big lives, let the mage finish it; bow the 9 ranged big instead.

After attacking the 9 ranged big, move east and Blowpipe
the <Range>8 ranged small</Range> that is now entering the room. Afterwards,
return to the west, killing splits along the way.

Chin the <Range>wave 10 west and south doubles</Range>, then clean up any ranged
smalls that lived. You can chin west and south then do 1 Blowpipe before first
tick Ayaking the <Mage>11 west mage big</Mage>. If you noodled on the chins,
prioritize cleaning up the room before Ayaking the mage big.

#### Waves 11-12 [#ranger-waves-11-12]

Continue killing splits and be ready to Scythe the

<Melee>wave 12 west melee</Melee> doubles. If your melee one-shot the wave 11
mage big, its splits will spawn in front of your wave 12 melee doubles, so you
can Blowpipe 1 or 2 of these before you Scythe.

Stand one tile back from the barrier after Scything the doubles. If you wait
briefly after Scything the double before switching back to your ranged gear,
you will automatically be pushed back 1 tile. You can see this in the
[example VOD](#ranger-example-pov).

#### Wave 13 [#ranger-wave-13]

Blowpipe the <Range>west wave 13 ranged small</Range> and path diagonally toward
the south. Kill the <Range>south wave 13 ranged small</Range> along with any
ranged splits in the room.

#### Waves 14-15 [#ranger-waves-14-15]

Pay attention to how far ahead your mage is. If they are behind, Ayak the

<Mage>wave 14 south small</Mage> then Blowpipe the <Range>ranged small</Range>
next to it and move east. Blowpipe the <Range>14 east ranged big</Range> if you
are ahead. Otherwise, Ayak the <Mage>15 east mage small</Mage> and Blowpipe the
<Range>ranged small</Range> next to it before killing the 14 big.

#### Waves 16-17 [#ranger-waves-16-17]

If you didn't noodle on previous waves, you can Blowpipe
the <Range>15 west ranged small</Range> or chin the
incoming <Range>wave 16 ranged small</Range> before it flashes then Ayak
the <Mage>wave 17 west mage big</Mage> before it flashes as well.

#### Waves 18-20 [#ranger-waves-18-20]

Kill splits from the 17 big(s) while waiting for the 18 big rangers to
come into the room. Blowpipe the <Range>west 18 big aggro</Range> on

<Tooltip text="When the wave 19 mage bigs flicker melee. The ranged big will be roughly in the center of the room.">
  tick 14
</Tooltip>

so that its splits spawn after the cap increase. Kill the other 2 after
the west one is dead. If you kill these early enough, hit splits until
the <Melee>wave 20 west big</Melee> flashes green then bow it.

<Notice>

Proficient teams can opt to play waves 17&ndash;20 more aggressively depending
on the room state.

- If the 12 melee big is killed, you can commit to killing the 17 west mage big.
- If the 17 east and west mage bigs are killed, you should clean up splits
  before bowing the 18 west ranged big when it spawns. Continue killing splits
  until the 19 mage bigs are about to flash melee, then kill the rest of the 18
  ranged bigs.
- If the room is not clean enough to bow the 18 west ranged big, clean splits
  until wave 19 spawns. Wait 2 ticks then Ayak the 19 south mage big and start
  killing all the 18 ranged bigs. (Tip: Blowpipe a non-aggro 18 big before
  Blowpiping the west aggro big to prevent overkill from Veng/thralls.)

</Notice>

### Post-cap [#ranger-post-cap]

#### Waves 21-22 [#ranger-waves-21-22]

After you bow the 20 west big, you can do 6-8 ticks worth of attacks and then
chin the <Range>east wave 21 ranged doubles</Range>. 6 ticks of attacks will let
you chin them tick perfect; you don't want to do more than 8 or you will chin
after the wave 22 check. After you chin, kill splits in the room until the

<Melee>wave 22 west big</Melee> flashes green and bow it.

A more advanced method is to Claw spec the <Melee>20 west big</Melee>, then fill
5 ticks worth of attacks before first tick chinning
the <Range>east wave 21 ranged doubles</Range>. Cast Death Charge any time after
the Claw spec to regen 100 spec for the boss.

#### Waves 23-25 [#ranger-waves-23-25]

After bowing the 22 west big, make your way to the south lane. You can do 1
Blowpipe then bow the <Range>south wave 23 ranged big</Range> tick perfectly.
After you bow it, run west and kill the right (N) then left (S) smalls as they
flash ranged. Bow the <Range>24 west big</Range> after the second Blowpipe.

Head south. You can do 1 Blowpipe before bowing the <Range>wave 25 south ranged big</Range>
if the room is clean. If you one-shot the wave 23 south range big earlier, its
splits will spawn in the lane and you should Blowpipe one of these if either are
ranged. If the room is not clean, clean up some smalls before Blowpiping the 25
south ranged big.

#### Waves 26-27 [#ranger-waves-26-27]

After you bow the wave 25 south big, start cleaning up any range splits you see.
Don't get baited into killing splits that will soon expire (any splits from wave
20 or 21 will expire before 28 check), and try to stay on tick with the room
(Blowpipe will keep you on tick with the room assuming you don't lose any ticks;
if you chin or Ayak, you will have to either do a second chin/Ayak or lose a
tick). Kill the <Range>wave 27 south big</Range> once it turns green.

A more advanced method you can use if the room is clean after killing the 25
south ranged big is to help Ayak the 26 or 27 east mage bigs before Blowpiping
the 27 south ranged big once it turns green.

#### Waves 28-29 [#ranger-waves-28-29]

Start looking for ranged/mage splits that spawned after wave 28 while making
your way west, and prioritize Blowpiping or Ayaking these instead of the wave 28
south flashers (which will expire in cleanup). Kill splits on the east side of
the room first as you move west.

Blowpipe the wave 29 west flashers. Your team will likely stall after this. Stay
on the west side of the room and hit splits/smalls that spawned after wave 28
while staying on tick (you are on tick with the room after Blowpiping the 29
flashers).

#### Waves 30-31 [#ranger-waves-30-31]

When wave 30 spawns, Blowpipe the <Range>west ranged big</Range> from 2 tiles
off the lane, then run 2 tiles back and chin the wave 30 south doubles when they
flash green (you must be on tick with the room for this; make sure you target
the eastern Nylo of the doubles). Blowpipe the wave 31 west flashers, then chin
the <Range>31 south doubles</Range>.

Alternatively, if wave 29 stalled and you are waiting for wave 30 after running
out of new splits to kill, you can first tick Blowpipe the wave 30 west ranged
big from the barrier, then run 4 tiles back to chin the wave 30 south doubles.

### Cleanup [#ranger-cleanup]

Kill any wave 29/31 smalls first as these will change color if you don't kill
them quickly enough. Don't get baited into chinning a clump with 28s in it as
28s will expire. After killing any 29+ rangers, look to kill other colors
(mage > melee), working from the south to the north side.

## Melee Waves

<Notice type="warning">

This guide is out of date. Its general principles are still valid, but the way
specific waves are handled by efficient teams has changed. It can still be worth
learning to get an understanding of your role's responsibilities.

</Notice>

### Pre-cap [#melee-pre-cap]

#### Waves 1-5 [#melee-waves-1-5]

Sang the <Mage>wave 1 south mage</Mage>, swift the <Melee>east small</Melee>,
sang the <Mage>south wave 4 big</Mage> and then bow the <Range>west wave 5 ranged big</Range>.
Kill the <Melee>melee aggro from wave 2</Melee>, and then the splits from the
big mage south. Hit splits from west ranged big until wave 6 enters the lane.

#### Waves 6-9 [#melee-waves-6-9]

Claw the <Melee>wave 6 east big</Melee> as soon as it enters the room, then
swift <Melee>the small</Melee> behind it. If you intend to Dinh's spec later,
scythe the big instead. After killing the small, the splits from the w6 big you
just killed and the ranged south big will spawn: first, kill any melee splits
from the east big melee before pathing south to hit the ranged big's splits and
the <Melee>wave 8 melee small</Melee>. Then, go west for the

<Melee>wave 9 melee</Melee>.

#### Wave 10 [#melee-wave-10]

Clean up splits from the wave 8 and 9 bigs while your ranger and mage deal with
wave 10.

#### Wave 11 [#melee-wave-11]

Sang or <Tooltip text="The dragonfire shield's special effect is used by players attempting Nylo wave speedruns. If you're just running regular raids, ignore this.">DFS</Tooltip>
the <Mage>west big mage aggro</Mage>, then path east to hit splits from the wave
10 east big.

#### Wave 12 [#melee-wave-12]

Scythe the <Melee>east melee doubles</Melee>. If they survive, finish them with
your Swift, then head south for wave 13.

#### Wave 13 [#melee-wave-13]

Swift the <Melee>south melee</Melee>, filling ticks on the splits from the w10
or w11 bigs (or Blowpipe the <Range>south w13</Range> in the lane).
Leave the <Melee>w13 big melee aggro</Melee> until tick 22, then kill it
(clicking on tick 21). You can base when to kill it off of where wave 15 is in
the lane.

#### Waves 14-15 [#melee-waves-14-15]

Kill the <Melee>w14 west small</Melee>, pop your delayed wave 13 big, then kill
the <Melee>w15 west small</Melee>.

#### Waves 16-17 [#melee-waves-16-17]

If the room looks clean, and especially if your mage killed the wave 12 big,
Sang or DFS the <Mage>w17 west big mage</Mage> in the lane. Otherwise, help
with splits and any w16s.

#### Wave 18 [#melee-wave-18]

Kill splits from any popped w17 bigs while waiting for wave 19 to spawn, and
clean up other splits in room if necessary.

#### Wave 19 [#melee-wave-19]

For the wave 20 check, 1 w15, 3 w18s and 3 w19s will always be alive (7/12).
This means that the number of smalls you can have in the room depends on how
many of the wave 17 bigs were killed:

- All 3 w17s died: up to 4 smalls
- 2 w17s died: up to 3 smalls
- 1 w17 died: up to 2 smalls

Prioritize killing smalls until you get below this threshold. If you recognize
that you are not going to stall, sang the <Mage>west 19</Mage> in the lane and
start helping with other 18s/19s.

### Post-cap [#melee-post-cap]

#### Waves 20-22 [#melee-waves-20-22]

Kill the <Melee>east big</Melee> (Scythe or Blowpipe <i className="fas fa-arrow-right" /> Swift).
If the mage and ranger have not managed to kill the south and west bigs, finish
them off. Splits need to spawn by 1:45.6 to expire before the stall check on
wave 28. After these bigs hit stuff in the room until it's time to Scythe
the <Melee>21 and 22 south doubles</Melee>.

#### Wave 23 [#melee-wave-23]

Focus the splits from the new bigs your mage and ranger should have just killed,
ignoring any Nylos from wave 22 or before. Finish the <Melee>east 23 big</Melee>
if the mage noodled.

#### Waves 24-26 [#melee-waves-24-26]

Scythe the <Melee>w24 east big aggro</Melee> as soon as it enters the room then
Swift something. Scythe the <Melee>w25 west big aggro</Melee> then Swift
something. Scythe the <Melee>w26 south big</Melee>.

#### Waves 27-28 [#melee-waves-27-28]

By the time you kill the 26 big, 28 should have spawned. A lot of bigs will just
have died and be spawning splits. Kill as many of the splits that spawned after
wave 28 as you can until it's time to hit wave 29.

#### Wave 29 [#melee-wave-29]

Kill the <Melee>south big melee</Melee> on the first tick possible, then go east
to kill the <Melee>small melee</Melee> from the same wave before it turns.

#### Wave 30 [#melee-wave-30]

If the ranger didn't kill both of the south 30s, make sure they are dead before
they turn.

### Cleanup [#melee-cleanup]

At this point, kill all relevant melees starting from the south. Fill ticks on
rangers or mages at your discretion if you need to. Ranger and or mage should
help with north melees if they finish before you; if you finish the melees
first, help them as needed.
