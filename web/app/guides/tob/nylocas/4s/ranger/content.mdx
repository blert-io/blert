## Prelude

This guide is part of Blert's series of max-eff Theatre of Blood 4s guides. It
is intended for players who already have a basic knowledge of the Theatre of
Blood and are looking to learn how to run efficient raids.

Refer to the [ToB Plugins guide](/guides/tob/plugins) for information about
useful plugins. Of particular note are the Nyloer plugin to track spawns and
splits, and Nylo Death Indicators to avoid doubling up on dead Nylos.

## Overview

<Notice type="warning">

This guide is out of date. Its general principles are still valid, but the way
specific waves are handled by efficient teams has changed. It can still be worth
learning to get an understanding of your role's responsibilities.

</Notice>

As a Ranger, it is essential to know that the Nylocas room runs on a 4-tick
cycle and how your attacks line up with that cycle. In the later wave, it is
extremely important to be on tick with the cycle, or you **WILL** miss prefires.

Given this, in most cases it is not worth throwing chins at pillar stacks before
cleanup, as it will require you to stall a tick to get back in cycle.

When chinning pillar stacks, attack the corner tiles to hit Nylos on both sides.

## Pre-cap

### Waves 1-3

Bow the <Range>wave 1 west small</Range>, the <Range>wave 2 east small</Range>,
and the <Range>wave 3 south small</Range>.

### Waves 4-5

Blowpipe the <Range>wave 4 west small</Range>, then bow the

<Range>wave 5 west big</Range>. If the big doesn't die, finish it with your
Blowpipe.

If the wave 4 south mage big died instantly, get ready to hit any ranged splits
from it. If it didn't, you can Claw scratch the wave 5 south melee small before
hitting the splits.

### Waves 6-7

Chin the <Range>wave 6 south small</Range>, then bow the

<Range>wave 7 south big</Range>. Finish it with your Blowpipe.

### Wave 8

Sang the <Mage>wave 8 west mage big</Mage>.

### Wave 9

Bow the <Range>west ranged big</Range>, then kill any ranged splits from the
wave 8 mage.

### Wave 10

Chin the <Range>west ranged doubles</Range> followed by the

<Range>south ranged doubles</Range>. If you are on tick for these, you can do
one Blowpipe before your next prefire.

### Wave 11

Sang the <Mage>west mage big</Mage>.

If your Melee Freeze didn't kill the wave 10 east ranged big, finish it instead
of prefiring 11. You can also Blowpipe any wave 10 rangers that didn't die.

### Wave 12

Scythe the <Melee>south melee big</Melee>. Make sure that you activate Piety
and equip as many melee switches as you can.

### Wave 13

Clean up ranged smalls in the room, as well as those entering from the south and
west lane.

### Wave 14

Keep hitting smalls, then kill the <Range>east ranged big</Range> when it enters
the room. Waiting until it enters the room before attacking it lowers the chance
of stalling when its splits spawn.

### Waves 15-16

Attack smalls coming down the lanes as well as those in the room.

A more advanced method for these waves can optionally be done. If you kill the
14 big quickly, you can Blowpipe the 15 east ranged small as soon as it is in
attack range, then run west to Blowpipe 15 west, chin 16 west, then Sang 17
west first tick. An example is shown below.

### Wave 17

Sang the <Mage>west mage big</Mage>. If you are first tick to this, you can
then do 4 Blowpipes.

### Wave 18

Bow the <Range>west range big</Range> **on the first tick**. If it doesn't die,
don't hit it again until it reaches the room and aggros someone to avoid
stalling 19.

### Wave 19

Kill any 18 ranged bigs that are still alive.

## Post-cap

### Wave 20

Bow the west big as it flashes ranged in lane. After this, you can fill 6-8
ticks before your next prefire. (e.g. 3 Blowpipes, 2 Blowpipes and a Sang,
etc.)

### Wave 21

Chin the <Range>east ranged doubles</Range>. If you chinned them first tick, you
can Blowpipe 5 times before your next prefire; if you were late, only do 4.

### Wave 22

Bow the west big as it flashes ranged in lane, then move south. You can do 1
Blowpipe before your next prefire.

### Wave 23

Bow the <Range>south ranged big</Range>, then run west to Blowpipe the northern
small flasher.

### Wave 24

Bow the west big, then move south again. You can do 1 Blowpipe before your next
prefire.

### Waves 25-26

Bow the <Range>wave 25 south ranged big</Range>. Finish it off with your
Blowpipe if not dead.

From here until wave 27, kill as many smalls as possible. Only hit smalls that
are 23 and above. If there are none, you can back up either 27 east or west if
your mages didn't one-shot them.

### Wave 27

Blowpipe the <Range>south ranged big</Range> until it dies.

From this point forward, you can expect to stall a couple times, so you may need
to fill with Blowpipes between your lane prefires.

### Wave 28

Blowpipe the south smalls as they flash ranged: first the east, then the west
one. Make sure the western flasher dies.

If wave 29 doesn't stall, path west so that you can hit the west flashers.

If it took a while to kill the 27 big, you can choose to Blowpipe only the
eastern flasher, as the other enters as ranged.

### Wave 29

Blowpipe the west small flashers: first north, then south. If wave 30 doesn't
stall, you can only hit the northern flasher before having to hit the 30 west
big.

### Wave 30

Blowpipe the <Range>west ranged big</Range> as soon as it enters Blowpipe
range.

It is essential that this big dies quickly. If your first Blowpipe doesn't kill
it, Blowpipe something else once then return to the big until it dies. (If the
28 south western flasher is still alive, you should Blowpipe it.)

### Wave 31

Blowpipe the west small flashers—first north then south—then chin the south
doubles.

If the 30 big didn't die to your first Blowpipe and you didn't stall, you can
only hit the northern flasher before going back to finish the big.

**If either of the 31 south smalls you chinned is still alive, they MUST die
fast, as they will switch style, which can mess up cleanup.**

## Cleanup

Chin and Blowpipe rangers, sweeping from south to north. Remember to chin on
corner tiles.

For a more consistent cleanup it is better to Blowpipe unless there are 3 or
more rangers stacked, though chins do have more potential for faster cleanups.
