## Prelude

This guide is part of Blert's series of max-eff Theatre of Blood 4s guides. It
is intended for players who already have a basic knowledge of the Theatre of
Blood and are looking to learn how to run efficient raids.

Refer to the [ToB Plugins guide](/guides/tob/plugins) for information about
useful plugins. Of particular note are the Nyloer plugin to track spawns and
splits, and Nylo Death Indicators to avoid doubling up on dead Nylos.

## Overview

<Notice type="warning">

This guide is out of date. Its general principles are still valid, but the way
specific waves are handled by efficient teams has changed. It can still be worth
learning to get an understanding of your role's responsibilities.

</Notice>

As a Melee, there are several things you should keep in mind throughout the
waves:

- When killing splits, prioritize them in the following order:
  <Melee>melee</Melee>, <Range>ranged</Range>, <Mage>mage</Mage>.
- In the later waves, don't overuse your Blowpipe or Sang, as you're the only
  person on the team killing melees in the south and west.
- Remember to regularly cast Vengeance on yourself and your teammates throughout
  the waves.
- Keep an empty inventory slot and put all of your two-handed weapons around it,
  so that your defender always ends up next to your weapon.

  An example inventory arrangement is shown below.

## Pre-cap

### Wave 1

You have two options for starting the waves:

- Double up with your Mage by Sanging the <Mage>wave 1 south</Mage> and the
  <Mage>wave 2 west</Mage>.
- Double up with your Ranger by bowing the <Range>wave 1 west</Range> and the
  <Range>wave 2 east</Range>.

### Waves 2-3

After your second attack, kill the <Melee>wave 2 south small</Melee>,
then the <Melee>wave 3 west small</Melee>.

### Waves 4-5

Help your Ranger by Blowpiping the <Range>wave 4 west small</Range> followed by
the <Range>wave 5 west big</Range>, then move south to hit the <Melee>wave 5 melee</Melee>.

### Waves 6-7

Clean up splits from the south and west, and help your Ranger with
the <Range>wave 7 south big</Range>.

### Waves 8-9

Sang the <Mage>wave 8 west big</Mage> first tick, then bow
the <Range>wave 9 west ranged big</Range> immediately after.

### Wave 10

Clean up splits from the bigs that died.

### Wave 11

Sang the <Mage>wave 11 west big</Mage> first tick and commit to the kill. If
any rangers from wave 10 west are still alive, you can Blowpipe once before
Sanging 11.

### Wave 12

Scythe the <Melee>west melee doubles</Melee>. If the wave 11 mage big died
first tick, you have time to Swift or Blowpipe a split before Scything the
doubles.

Afterwards, clean up splits before the next wave.

### Wave 13

Kill the <Melee>south melee small</Melee>. If there are no melees in the room
at this point, you can Blowpipe the west ranger before dealing with south.

### Wave 14

Kill the <Melee>west melee small</Melee>.

### Waves 15-16

Blowpipe the <Range>15 west ranged small</Range>, then Swift the <Melee>melee small</Melee>
next to it. Stay west and hit something in the room before your next prefire.

### Wave 17

Sang the <Mage>west mage big</Mage> on the first tick. If it doesn't die, do
one Swift or Blowpipe before Sanging it again.

### Wave 18

Clean up splits in the room.

### Wave 19

If the room is clean and you killed wave 17 first tick, you can Sang the west
mage big first tick. If you do this, make sure to stand one tile away from the
gate when you attack it, so that its splits spawn following the wave 20 check.

If there are many splits in the room, focus on killing them instead of prefiring 19.

## Post-cap

### Wave 20

Clean as many splits in the room as you can. Be prepared to Scythe the

<Melee>west big</Melee> as soon as it enters the room if your Ranger didn't kill
it.

### Wave 21

Scythe the <Melee>south melee doubles</Melee>, then do one Swift.

### Wave 22

Scythe the <Melee>south melee doubles</Melee>, then path west.

Optionally, you can choose to do a more advanced method for this wave:

1. Blowpipe the western 22 small in the south lane as it flickers ranged.
2. Swift the other south small when it enters the room.
3. Bow the 23 south big first tick and continue your regular rotation.

If you do this, pay attention to 22 west—if your Ranger doesn't kill it, finish
it off instead of bowing 23.

### Wave 23

Kill splits that spawned from the wave 22 west big. At this point, only hit
Nylos that are 23 or above, as the rest will expire before wave 28.

### Wave 24

Path south and kill splits from the wave 23 south big.

Be prepared to finish the wave 24 west big as it enters the room if your Ranger
didn't kill it. (Advanced: If you notice your Ranger doesn't instantly kill 24,
you can Blowpipe it once in lane before it switches to melee.)

### Wave 25

Scythe the <Melee>west big</Melee> as soon as it enters the room. If your
Ranger killed the 24 big, you can Blowpipe one of its splits once before
Scything 25.

After Scything the 25, you have 4 ticks to fill. You can Swift once and lose a
tick, Blowpipe twice or Sang once. Path south as you do this.

### Wave 26

Scythe the <Melee>south big</Melee> as it enters the room. From this point on,
you should stay south.

### Waves 27-28

Clean up the room as much as you can.

Keep an eye on the 28 south flashers: if your Ranger doesn't kill the eastern
one, it will enter the room as melee and you must kill it as quickly as possible.

### Wave 29

Scythe the <Melee>south melee big</Melee> as soon as it enters the room.

If the wave 28 flasher didn't die before this, kill it immediately after the 29
big.

### Wave 30

Scythe the <Melee>south melee doubles</Melee>. If either of them survive,
prioritize killing them.

### Wave 31

Watch the splits spawning from the 30 west range and east mage bigs—if they
walk south, prioritize them over other Nylos.

## Cleanup

During cleanup, your job is to kill clear out melees in the south side of the
room. Make sure to always hit higher wave Nylos first.
