# Getting Started with Blert

This guide will walk you through the steps to get Blert running in
RuneLite and start recording your first challenge.

## Step 1: Download the Blert Plugin

Download the Blert plugin from the
[RuneLite Plugin Hub](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/blert).

## Step 2: Create a Blert Account

If you don't already have a Blert account,
[sign up here](/register). Your Blert username doesn't have to be the same as
your OSRS account. Verify your email address to ensure you don't lose access to
your account.

## Step 3: Request API Key Access

Open your [Linked Accounts](/settings/linked-accounts) page and click the
**Generate Linking Code** button under the **Discord** section. Copy the
generated code, then run the `/verify <code>` command in
[Blert's Discord](https://discord.gg/c5Hgv3NnYe).

Once your Discord account is linked, ping a

<strong style={{ color: '#e91e63' }}>@Support</strong> asking for API key
access.

## Step 4: Generate Your API Key

1. Once you have API key access, go to the
   [API Keys page](/settings/api-keys).
2. Enter your OSRS username in the **Generate new API key**
   section and click **Generate API Key**.
3. Copy the generated key using the <i className="fas fa-copy" /> copy
   icon.

/>

## Step 5: Enter the Key in RuneLite

1. Open RuneLite and go to the **Blert** plugin settings.
2. Paste your API key into the **Blert API Key** field.
3. Close the settings tab and you're done!

You can confirm the plugin is connected by clicking the Bloat icon in your
RuneLite sidebar. If everything is working, you'll see your username and
connection status listed at the top of the plugin panel.

## Step 6: Record Your First PvM Challenge

You're now ready to start recording! Enter any PvM challenge like the
Theatre of Blood or Inferno and Blert will automatically detect your run
and begin tracking data.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key

- Double-check that you copied the full key.
- Ensure the key is associated with the OSRS name you're logged into.
- If needed, regenerate the key from the
  [API Keys page](/settings/api-keys).

### No Data Uploading

- Open the plugin sidebar and confirm you see your username connected.
- Ensure the raid was properly started (e.g. not in a lobby).
- Data is uploaded at the end of challenge stages (e.g. rooms/waves), so if
  you're still in the middle of one, you won't see anything.
- If you were spectating a raid and left early, it won't be uploaded.

### No Permission to Generate Key

- You haven't been granted API access yet.
- [Link your Discord account](#step-3-request-api-key-access) and ping
  <strong style={{ color: '#e91e63' }}>@Support</strong> in Discord to request
  access.
